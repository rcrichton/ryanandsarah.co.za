Time is marching on and there are now less than 100 days until we get married. We
have recently sent out our save the dates and I hope that all of you have
received them by now. We have also just sent out our invitations or we will be
hand delivering them to you shortly for those that live in Durbs.

Here is a sneak peek of what to look out for.

We think that the invitation came out great and hope that you all like them!

In case you haven't received a save the date yet, here is a digital copy.

Our other preparations have been going well, and we are well on track to have an
epic party come 12th March next year!
