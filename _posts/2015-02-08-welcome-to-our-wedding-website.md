Welcome to our wedding website! Here, Sarah and I will post details on the progress of our planning. Please keep checking back to keep up-to-date with what we are up to.

First up, we are concentrating our efforts on finding an awesome venue for our wedding. We are looking for a spot in the Midlands for a rustic, country-style wedding. In the beginning of January we set off on a 2 day adventure to explore what the Midlands had to offer. In 2 days we saw 8 great places!

To plan our trip we drew up a map of all the places we wanted to visit. I used [Google's My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps) to keep us organised. Here is the map we used showing the places that we visited:
