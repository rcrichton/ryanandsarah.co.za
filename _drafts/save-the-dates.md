Time is marching on and there are now less than 4 month until we get married. We
have recently sent out our save the dates and I hope that all of you will receive
yours soon. I don't have much faith in the SA postal service to here is a copy of
the save the date for those that get lost in the post!

Invitations will follow shortly and they are looking amazing!

Our other preparations have been going well, all the main stuff is booked. DJ,
check, photographer, check, videographer, check, wedding dress, check, suits,
... erm, well I still have a few thing things to sort out :)
